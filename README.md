# camagru_mvc
first web project in 42 cursus
This first project puts you back in the bath after the PHP pool: you will have to build, in PHP, a small Instagram-like site allowing users to make and share photo-montages. You will thus implement, with your bare hands (frameworks are forbidden), the basic functionalities found on most sites with a user base.
